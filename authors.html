					<h1>The authors</h1>
					<h2 id="stuart">Dr Stuart Lowe</h2>
					<p>Stuart Lowe has previously worked at <a href="http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/">Jodrell Bank Observatory</a> where he helped build astronomical instruments used on radio telescopes in the UK and Poland. At the <a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>, he worked on the European Space Agency's <a href="http://planck.cf.ac.uk/">Planck satellite</a>, which was launched in 2009 to look at the echoes of the Big Bang. He co-founded the UK's longest running, regular, astronomy podcast - <a href="http://www.jodcast.net/">The Jodcast</a>. More recently he has built web-interfaces that allow everyone, from professional astronomers to school children, to observe with the <a href="http://lcogt.net/">Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope network</a>.</p>
					<h2 id="chris">Dr Chris North</h2>
					<p>Chris North is an astrophysicist at <a href="http://www.cf.ac.uk/">Cardiff University</a>. Having worked on a number of experiments and space missions, he is currently part of the <a href="http://herschel.cf.ac.uk/">Herschel Space Observatory</a> team, looking at far-infrared light from star forming in our galaxy and across the Universe. As well as research, Chris is heavily involved in outreach engagement at Cardiff, speaking to teachers, schools, and anyone else who'll listen about space and astronomy. He has made regular appearances on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/skyatnight">BBC Sky at Night</a> for a number of years.</p>
					<p>Chris and Stuart first met whilst working on the <a href="http://planck.cf.ac.uk/">Planck satellite</a>. This led to the development of the popular <a href="http://www.chromoscope.net/">chromoscope.net</a> project, which allowed people to view the Universe in a whole new light. Their partnership has included websites that enable people to <a href="http://starinabox.lcogt.net/">track the lifecycle of stars</a>, <a href="http://chrisnorth.github.io/design-a-space-telescope/">design their very own space telescope</a>, and even <a href="https://chrisnorth.github.io/planckapps/Simulator/">play with the properties of the cosmos</a>. They can often be found looking for new ways to help people understand the Universe we live in.</p>
